Who wants to be a Javascript Dev - Quiz game project

Built using HTML, css, scss, bootstrap, and javascript. 

The goal was to create a game project using our newly found understanding of javascript, using all we've learnt to the previous unit as well.
I looked into a few ideas, but settled on a quiz game based on javascript knowledge. 
Which has a lives system based on wrong answers and a points system that marks the user based on how many quesgtions they get right.
Uses functions and onclick events, to handle buttons being pressed and excute code based on if the answer they choose was correct.
I also use PSEUDOCODE to set up the script.js file, which helped some much with understanding what functions need to be built.
And what to start in what order to ensure everything could be tested correctly.


The game is live via github pages here: https://nathan-beers.github.io/javascript-quiz/
