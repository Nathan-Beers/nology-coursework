16 Bit Calculator project

A working calculator made to look like a 16 bit gameboy like style.
Originally I had planned to make this project more of a normal style calculator, using buttons for each of the numbers.
However I was unable to get the functionality working, and instead opted for two inputs for numbers and a dropdown for operators.

Created using html, css, scss, javascript.
